This vocabulary is divided into two main portions: (1) Railway infrastructure, and (2) Authorized vehicles. The Railway infrastructure portion contains two layers: the Implementation layer that represents the tracks and their related concepts, the line sections, and the operational points, and the Abstraction layer where the network topological concepts are defined. Additionally it reuses the <tt>geosparql</tt> pattern for operational points that are seen as geographical features that have a certain geometry, e.g. coordinates. The Authorized vehicles portion contains information on the vehicles and their keepers, and the vehicle types and their manufacturers.
    
An [era:OperationalPoint](#OperationalPoint) is any location for train service operations, where train services may begin and end or change route, and where passenger or freight services may be provided. The [era:SectionOfLine](#SectionOfLine) is the part of the line between adjacent operational points. These adjacent operational points are defined by properties [era:opStart](#opStart) and [era:opEnd](#opPEnd) which indicate the beginning and the end of a line section. A line section may consist of several tracks; also the operational point is related to one or more tracks. Both relationships are represented by the property [era:track](#track). An [era:Track](#Track) is any running track used for train service movements, and the [era:Siding](#Siding) is any track within an operational point, which is not used for operational routing of a train. An operational point is related to a siding through the property [era:siding](#siding).
    
The following example shows the RDF representaton an operational point 'ATIz' (Inzersdorf Ort (in Iz)) which is part of the Austrian railway infrastructure,  that has seven tracks:

An operational point is a [geosparql:Feature](http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#Feature) that [geosparql:hasGeometry](http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#hasGeometry) a certain location  ([geosparql:Geometry](http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#Geometry)).

In Figure 1 you can see that a Track may have several platforms ([era:platform](#platform)), a train detection system ([era:trainDetectionSystem](#trainDetectionSystem)), a contact line system ([contactLineSystem](#contactLineSystem)), and the ETCS level ([era:etcsLevel](#etcsLevel)). 
    
A [era:Vehicle](#Vehicle) belongs to a [era:VehicleType](#VehicleType) that has been authorized to operate on the European railway infrastructure. The vehicle is owned ([era:vehicleKeeper](#vehicleKeeper)) by a [era:VehicleKeeper](#VehicleKeeper). A vehicle type is manufactured ([era:manufacturer](#manufacturer)) by a [era:Manufacturer](#Manufacturer). Both manufacturers and vehicle keepers are subclasses of [org:Organization](#Organization).
    
The next example shows the [era:VehicleType](#VehicleType)  with [era:alternativeName](#alternativeName) "Eurolight IIIA". Its [era:manufacturer](#manufacturer) is "Stadler Rail Valencia S.A.U.".
