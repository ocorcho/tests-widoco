This ontology is part of the <a href="https://vocab.plataformasimple.es/def/logistics/federated/" target="_blank">SIMPLE ontology network</a>, a network of ontologies that mimic the structure of the ontology network created in the context of the FEDeRATED project with the objective of facilitating the representation of information related to logistic processes. Both ontology networks consist of 6 ontologies: Business Service, Event, Logistic Roles, Digital Twin, Physical Infrastructures and Classifications.
<p>The main design decisions for the whole ontology network (main classes and how they are interrelated, event model, transactions, etc.) can be found as part of the documentation of the project FEDeRATED, and the ontology network is maintained in a <a href="https://github.com/silenroc1/FEDeRATED-Semantic-Model" target="_blank">GitHub repository</a>, where users are submitting <a href="https://github.com/silenroc1/FEDeRATED-Semantic-Model/issues">issues</a> requesting changes. In SIMPLE, we have only decided to extend those classes or properties that could not be found in that ontology network and that were needed according to the needs of the main stakeholders.</p>
<p>A combined view of the whole set of ontologies for SIMPLE, with some usage examples, can be found <a href="https://vocab.plataformasimple.es/def/logistics/federated/" target="_blank">here</a>.
