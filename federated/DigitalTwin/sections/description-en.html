<p>This ontology only provides two additions, for the time being, to the corresponding ontology in FEDeRATED, namely the addition of the concept <a href="#CMR">CMR</a> as a type of Document that is handled in the context of road transport, and the property of <a href="#relatedDocumentation">relatedDocumentation</a> to allow adding a reference from any business transaction to a document that provides additional information to it.</p>
<p>Examples of usage of many of these classes and properties can be found on the <a href="https://vocab.plataformasimple.es/def/logistics/federated/">SIMPLE ontology network documentation</a>.</p>
