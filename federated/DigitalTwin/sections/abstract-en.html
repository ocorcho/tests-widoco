<h2>Abstract</h2><span class="markdown">
This ontology extends the Digital Twin ontology created in the context of the FEDeRATED project. It has been created in the context of project SIMPLE so as to allow representing entities associated to the digital twin of the logictis process. More specifically, it includes the concept of CMR, largely used in road transport, and allows associating some physical documentation to business transactions.</span>
