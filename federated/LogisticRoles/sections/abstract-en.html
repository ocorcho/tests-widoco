<h2>Abstract</h2><span class="markdown">
This ontology extends the Logistic Roles ontology created in the context of the FEDeRATED project. It has been created in the context of project SIMPLE so as to allow representing entities associated to logistic roles. More specifically, it extends the FEDeRATED Logistic Roles ontology with concepts such as Driver, as a subclass of a Logistics Service Provider. It also creates some properties that should be better included in the corresponding FEDeRATED ontology, such as involves and isAbout, that allow connecting LocationRoles and ActorRoles with their corresponding locations, Events and TransportMeans, and with the corresponding LegalPerson, respectively. </span>
