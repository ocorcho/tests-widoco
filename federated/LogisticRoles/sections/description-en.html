For the time being, this ontology only adds a class to the existing classes and properties of the original <a href="https://ontology.tno.nl/logistics/federated/LogisticRoles" target="_blank">Logistic Roles ontology</a>. This is the class <a href="#Driver">Driver</a>.</span>
<span class="markdown">
No further classes or properties are added in this ontology, which only adds some restrictions to some of its main classes, which are expected to be added to the corresponding FEDeRATED ontology.</span>
