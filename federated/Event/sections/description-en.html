<p>This ontology extends the Event ontology defined in FEDeRATED with three types of events (represented as classes, as can be seen in the figure).</p>
<ul>
    <li><p><a href="#GateInEvent">GateInEvent</a> and <a href="#GateOutEvent">GateOutEvent</a>, which allow describing the events in which a vehicle enters or departs from a cargo terminal.</p></li>
    <li><p><a href="#IssueEvent">IssueEvent</a>, which allows representing any type of issue that may happen during the logistics process</p></li>
    </ul>
