<h2>Abstract</h2><span class="markdown">
This ontology extends the Event ontology created in the context of the FEDeRATED project. It has been created in the context of project SIMPLE so as to allow representing entities associated to events that were not included in that ontology and are considered useful in SIMPLE. More specifically, it extends the FEDeRATED Event ontology with concepts such as the GateInEvent and GateOutEvent, as well as the IssueEvent. </span>
