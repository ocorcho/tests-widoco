<h2>Abstract</h2><span class="markdown">
This ontology extends the Business Service ontology created in the context of the FEDeRATED project. It has been created in the context of project SIMPLE so as to allow representing entities associated to business transactions, logistic services and legal persons. More specifically, it extends the FEDeRATED Business Service ontology with concepts such as different types of orders (for Cargo Handling, Cargo Discharge, Gate-in and Gate-out, and Shunting Orders) and the logistic service associated to Cargo Handling. It also specialises the property that associates a location to a logistics service, so as to determine whether it is a departure or arrival location in the case of transport related services. And it also allows representing the relationship between Shipments and Consignments. </span>
