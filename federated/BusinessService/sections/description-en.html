<p>This ontology extends the Business Service ontology defined in FEDeRATED with several classes and properties that have een considered necessary in order to describe the types of cases that have been identified in SIMPLE by stakeholders. As in the corresponding FEDeRATED Business Service ontology, the main concepts are those of <a href="https://ontology.tno.nl/logistics/federated/BusinessService#BusinessTransaction" target="_blank">BusinessTransaction</a>, <a href="https://ontology.tno.nl/logistics/federated/BusinessService#LegalPerson" target="_blank">LegalPerson</a> and <a href="https://ontology.tno.nl/logistics/federated/BusinessService#LogisticsService" target="_blank">LogisticsService</a>.</p>
<p>The classes defined in the SIMPLE Business Service Ontology that extend BusinessTransaction (indeed, they all extend the class <a href="https://ontology.tno.nl/logistics/federated/BusinessService#Order" target="_blank">Order</a>, as shown in the figure) are:</p>
<ul>
    <li><a href="#CargoHandlingOrder">CargoHandlingOrder</a>, which allows describing those business transactions (orders) that have to do with the handling of cargo. That is, a company may agree with another to have their cargo handled in a rail freight terminal, for instance.</li>
    <li><a href="#DischargeOrder">DischargeOrder</a>, which allows representing the business transaction in which a which an organisation is made responsible of / agrees to discharge some cargo (e.g., inside a rail freight terminal as well).</li>
    <li><a href="#GateInOrder">GateInOrder</a> and <a href="#GateOutOrder">GateOutOrder</a>, which allow describing the orders that allow a transport means to go into or depart from a cargo terminal (e.g., a rail freight terminal). Although these may be considered as events, they may actually represent business transactions, and that is why they are included here.</li>
    <li><a href="#ShuntingOrder">ShuntingOrder</a>, which is associated to the process of sorting items of rolling stock into complete trains, or the reverse, and this may be subject again to a business transaction between different organisations (e.g., the rail freight terminal operator and a specific company working inside the rail freight terminal that is in charge of this type of operations.</li>
    </ul>

<p>The class defined in the SIMPLE Business Service Ontology that extend LogisticsService is:</p>
<ul><li><a href="#CargoHandlingService">CargoHandlingService</a>, which allows representing a logistics service that can be provided by an organisation in order to take care of the handling of cargo for another organisation. The place of this class in the class taxonomy can be observed in the figure</li></ul>

<p>This ontology also includes the object property <a href="#containsBusinessTransaction">containsBusinessTransaction</a> in order to relate a <a href="https://ontology.tno.nl/logistics/federated/BusinessService#Shipment" target="_blank">Shipment</a> with the <a href="https://ontology.tno.nl/logistics/federated/BusinessService#Consignment" target="_blank">Consignments</a> that it may consist of. We consider that this object property should be represented in the FEDeRATED ontology network, and this has been already requested. If accepted, this property will be deprecated from the SIMPLE Business Service ontology</p>
<p>Finally, the ontology also includes some data properties that can be used to describe the <a href="#expectedDeliveryTime">expectedDeliveryTime</a>, the <a href="#earliestDeliveryTime">earliestDeliveryTime</a> and the <a href="#latestDeliveryTime">latestDeliveryTime</a> of a Shipment or Consignment, which can be provided values either in the moment when the business transaction is created or later, when the corresponding logistics service is fixed.</p>
<p>Examples of usage of many of these classes and properties can be found on the <a href="https://vocab.plataformasimple.es/def/logistics/federated/">SIMPLE ontology network documentation</a>.</p>
