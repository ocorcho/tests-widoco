<h2>Abstract</h2><span class="markdown">
This document describes the domain ontology of the tourism sector built from the 'Conceptual Semantic Reference Model of Tourism' of SEGITTUR, a model for the development of a Network of Ontologies of the Tourism Sector at the service of the future Intelligent Destination Platform, promoted by SEGITTUR. The SEGITTUR Tourism Reference Conceptual Model offers an extensible ontology for the tourism domain, and aspires to become a reference for the controlled exchange of tourism information.</span>
