<p>The objective of this reference ontology is to have a representation of the tourism domain that includes the most important entities that conform it, including its attributes, the relationships between entities and its restrictions, and which can be extended to model its subdomains.</p>

<p>The ontology is based on the initial design of the Conceptual Reference Model of the tourism domain, whose objective was to define a semantic model aligned with the UNE 178503 standard which could be implemented as a guide and basis for the construction of an ontology network that digitally reflects the context of tourist consumption. This reference ontology has been developed by following good ontology engineering practices and taking into consideration the requirements and contributions of the distinct stakeholders involved in this domain, following a governance model designed specifically for the creation and maintenance of the ontology network.</p>
    
<p>The following infographic provides an overview of the organization of the ontology from a business perspective and organized into several tourism subdomains.</p>

<p>The infographic shows the components of the tourism domain that intervene and how they should relate to the interaction that occurs between organizations, tourism services, tourism resources and tourism destinations.</p>

<p>It is important to point out that this ontology does not contemplate the representation of the concept of Tourist, since it is fundamentally centered on the concepts and relationships that allow the tourist offer to be described. Nonetheless, the concepts, attributes, relationships and restrictions represented will make it easier for the tourist, as the final user, to find the relevant information necessary for their experience and to be able to draw an itinerary for their specific consumption.</p>
