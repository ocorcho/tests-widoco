<p>The objective of this conceptual model is to have a representation of the tourism domain that includes the most important entities that comprise it, as well as the relationships between them, and that serves to model the large areas or subdomains of the system. The application of the model will allow knowing, understanding or simulating any subject related to the set of concepts and entities that comprise it, in addition to serving as a basis for machines to understand the information they handle. In short, the present ontology that deploys the model is what allows it to be interpretable by machines.</p>

<p>The design of the Conceptual Reference Model of the tourism domain had the objective of defining a semantic model aligned with the UNE 178503 Standard that is used as a guide and basis for the construction of an Ontology Network that digitally reflects the context of tourism consumption.</p>

<p>However, this context involves an entire system that is involved in the activity and that is unmanageable. Therefore, the definition of the model started from a global projection of the tourism domain as well as its fragmentation into the main subdomains that comprise it. This division made it easier to limit the scope of the model and guide the selection of entities that comprise it. The proposed components are the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>Subdomain 1: Offer</li>
<li>Subdomain 2: Tourist</li>
<li>Subcomain 3: Destination</li>
</ul>
    
<p>Under this structure, the developed ontological model corresponds to a solid conceptual structure that not only comprehensively represents the key elements of tourism, but is also nourished by the entities that make up these 3 subdomains within which a vocabulary, taxonomies, classes, properties and specific relationships for tourism activity are deployed.</p>
    
<p>The following infographic provides an overview of the organization of the ontology from a business perspective and organized into the defined tourism subdomains.</p>

<p>The infographic shows the components of the tourism domain that are involved and how they relate to each other in the tourist interaction that occurs between the offer, the tourist and the destination. The tourist, in relation to specific demographic variables and a main motivation for the trip, will draw up a specific consumption itinerary. The relationships between classes and subclasses will make it easier for machines to help the tourist find the relevant information necessary for their experience.</p>

<p>The ontology comprises classes in the defined subdomains (offer, tourist, destination), of which several classes have been defined as ‘main classes’ from a business perspective. The main classes of the tourism domain that are included in both the model and the associated ontology are the central classes of the ontological model for the tourism field corresponding to the subdomains of offer, destination and tourist. The main classes comprise the fundamental categories and the group of subclasses that share common characteristics with the one represented by said category.</p>
